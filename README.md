# AWS-Cloud-Development-Management-Music-Subscription
On my recent AWS Cloud Development project for a Music Subscription service, I came across the comprehensive cloud infrastructure i designed and implemented. I dove deep into AWS's ecosystem, creating a robust network architecture with multiple Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and associated security groups. I set up and managed EC2 instances, which served as the backbone of our application. One of the most exciting aspects was working with a variety of AWS storage and database services. I configured S3 buckets for efficient data storage, implemented AWS Lambda functions for serverless computing, and set up both an RDS MySQL database and a DynamoDB table to handle different data needs. This project not only enhanced my technical skills but also gave me a holistic understanding of how various AWS services can be integrated to create a scalable and efficient cloud-based solution. It was challenging at times, but the sense of accomplishment when everything came together was incredibly rewarding
